I want to create a podcast website. The homepage will be a many cards of podcasts, and clicking on a card have a list(dg.mp3, pb.mp3, rv.mp3), podcast will allow you to play it and view its description and transaction in Markdown format. The podcast progress should be displayed in real-time, and clicking on transaction text will allow you to Jump to the corresponding time in the podcast. using the Astro framework and Tailwind CSS.

There are two folders(card) in the `resources` folder as input examples. Each MP3 file in each folder corresponds to a JSON file in the same format. Please help me write a technical implementation for this idea to ./specs/0002-plan.md
